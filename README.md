### Reflections and Comments

- Class provided ESLint file was modified with the following addition to permit use of template literals enclosed in backticks (`)

``` JSON
    "quotes": [
      "warn",
      "single",
      {
        "exceptions": {
          "allowTemplateLiterals": true
        }
      }
```
